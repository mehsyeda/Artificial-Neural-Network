# Artificial-Neural-Network
Artificial neural networks (ANN) or connectionist systems are computing systems vaguely inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains.Such systems "learn" to perform tasks by considering examples, generally without being programmed with task-specific rules.

An ANN is based on a collection of connected units or nodes called artificial neurons, which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain. Each connection, like the synapses in a biological brain, can transmit a signal to other neurons. An artificial neuron that receives a signal then processes it and can signal neurons connected to it.

# Applications

 Artificial neural networks have found applications in many disciplines. Application areas include system identification and control (vehicle control, trajectory prediction), pattern recognition (radar systems, face identification)
 ANNs have been used to diagnose cancers.They are also used used to accelerate reliability analysis of infrastructures subject to natural disasters and to predict foundation settlements.
